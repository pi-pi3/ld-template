# lib4-lua
`lib4-lua` is a collection of tiny lua files with filenames consisting of 4
letters + extension.

## included libraries:
- `util.lua` General purpose utilities for games.
- `lgui.lua` General purpose gui for games (requires l√∂ve).
- **collections**:
 - `list.lua` General purpose singly-linked list optimized with tail-calls.
 - `vec2.lua and `vec3.lua` Easy vectors for games.
- **other**:
 - `rect.lua` A rectangle for collision checks.

## util.lua
Most functions are documented and are so tiny, they're rather easy to understand.

## lgui.lua
Literally 10 comments in the entire file. I will document it sometime. For now,
look at how `src/menu.lua` uses `lgui` and launch the test suite using `love src`.

## Customization
To customize this repository for your project, you'll have to do the following:
1. customize this README
1. customize config.mk
3. change the name of the game in the following places:
 - release/linux/launch.sh (game title, aka $GAME)
 - release/mac/game.app (the name of this directory)
 - release/mac/game.app/Info.plist (all places marked with #XXX)
 - src/conf.lua (t.identity and t.window.title)
